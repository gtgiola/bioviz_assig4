Bioviz Assignment 4 Greg Giola

Algorithm based from http://www.avatar.se/molbioinfo2001/dynprog/dynamic.html
Data from http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/bcb4002/datasets.html

This web page compares 2 protein sequences.
This page will handle larger or smaller sequences but only two. However if they are two long the svg will need to be adjusted.
